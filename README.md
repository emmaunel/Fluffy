# Fluffy_Language
This is my own interpreter programming called Fluffy.

#Background

Fluffy was inspired by the language 'Chicken' which is an esoteric programming language.
I wanted Fluffy to be just like chicken except its tokens are different varient of 
the word Fluffy(e.g Fluffy, fluffY, FLuffy). But at the moment, it would be like
a regular programming language with variable names, functions, and so on.

#Usage

You must have at least python3.7 to run the interpreter.
python3.7 __init__.py to run the interpreter


# TODO

* Create a Lexer or use an open source Tool
    Status
	* Research(possibly gonna write in python)
	* Interesting thing, the tokens are put into a tree(glad I paid attention in CS141)
	* Add commands like clear and exit(to exit the interpreter)
	    * Done
* Create a Parser
    * Convert the tokens from the lexer into a tree and decide what each identifier is.
* That's it for now
