# Fluffy_Language `V1.0`
This is my own interpreter programming called Fluffy.

# Background

Fluffy was inspired by the language 'Chicken' which is an esoteric programming language.
I wanted Fluffy to be just like chicken except its tokens are different varient of 
the word Fluffy(e.g Fluffy, fluffY, FLuffy). But at the moment, it would be like
a regular programming language with variable names, functions, and so on.

# Installation

> `Note:` Soon to be updated

You must have at least python3.7 to run the interpreter.

python3.7 __init__.py to run the interpreter

 
 # Roadmap
- **Front-end**
    - [x] Create Lexical analyzer. 
        * Research(possibly gonna write in python)
        - [ ] Add commands like clear and exit(to exit the interpreter)
    - [ ] Create Parser
         
	    -[ ] Interesting thing, the tokens are put into a tree(glad I paid attention in CS141)(Add to Documentation)
	   
	    -[ ] Add commands like clear and exit(to exit the interpreter)
   
    -[ ] Create Parser
        * Convert the tokens from the lexer into a tree and decide what each identifier is.


- **Backend**
    - [ ] Code generation `Current`
    - [ ] Optimisation 
    - [ ] Strong typing 
    
- **Extra**
    - [ ] Write all docmentations in detail `0%`
